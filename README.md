# Maroon for Android (formerly Dawg Trails)
The student's interactive assistant for Mississippi State University

## About
As an entering freshman and Android user, I envied iOS users for having the ability to use BullyWalk to find their way around campus. Knowing that others were in the same boat as I was, I was motivated to start development an Android app that provides students with guidance around campus. I had no experience of Android programming before I started this project, but I had been proficient in Java programming. With the help of Google, support of friends, and other resources, Maroon was born.
